## What is shimming a tube?
This is the process where you take a tube out of a housing, and put a strip of electrical tape on the outside of the tube to push its centerline slightly more twoards the pogo pins. With it being slightly more off-center, you should have more adjustment range when you [collimate the tubes](/star-collimation/). If you're still having problems, try a second strip of tape over the top of the first.

If you're still having problems after that, ask on the Discord.
