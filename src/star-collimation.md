## Star Collimation
So, you've built a set of duals, and now you want to collimate them, so that your eyes and brain don't hurt after a while.

### Why do my eyes and brain hurt
Your eyes and brain hurt because when they're presented with two images are aren't **quite** aligned, they'll go ahead and move to align for you. Unfortunately, that's not how they're used to working, because it's slightly off from the normal feeling without a device in the way, and so they're getting used to being in the wrong place. Good collimation will help stop that.

### How do I do it
Pick a star. Look at it with both eyes, and then swing one pod into the view. If the star doesn't line up immediately, spin the whole diopter housing a bit to move the star. Swing the pod out of the way and look at the star with both eyes again. Repeat until the star is lined up with and without the pod, so that the pod doesn't make a difference. Now repeat for the other pod.

## What do I do if I can't line it up?
You may need to [shim the tube in the housing](/shim-tube/) to get it to line up.
